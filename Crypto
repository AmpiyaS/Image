Analyze the security and performance implications of post-quantum 
multiple encryption.


Introduction
Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in other terms quantum-resistant cryptography or quantum-safe cryptographyfocuses on developing cryptographic systems resistant to quantum computer attacks,
which threaten traditional algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC).The need for PQC emerged in the 1990s with the discovery of quantum algorithms like Shor's and Grover's, 
could break these classical systems. Research in the 2000s introduced quantum-resistant methods based on lattice problems, hash functions, and multivariate equations. In 2012, 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States launched the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project.
NIST called for submissions of cryptographic algorithms that were resistant to quantum attacks, with the goal of standardizing them by 2022.
This initiative was a pivotal moment in the field and spurred global research and development.NIST launched a project to standardize post-quantum algorithms, leading to the announcement of finalists like Kyber, NTRU, and FALCON in 2022.
As quantum computing advances, ongoing efforts aim to refine and implement these algorithms, 
transitioning cryptographic systems worldwide to ensure security in a quantum future.


Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has made a lot of progress in recent years, 
especially with the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project. 
In 2022, NIST picked algorithms like Kyber, NTRU, FALCON, and Rainbow to become official standards for quantum-resistant security. 
Many systems are also using hybrid cryptographic methods, which combine traditional encryption with post-quantum algorithms to stay secure for now. 
Researchers are still working on improving these algorithms for different uses, while the world gets ready for the potential rise of powerful quantum computers. 
The shift to quantum-safe encryption is happening, but it will take time to fully transition to systems that can handle future quantum threats.
